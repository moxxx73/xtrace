my (hopefully going to be) very epic strace
--------------------------------------------
the only other thing that will need implementing other than obvs  
the tracing itself is support for either spawning a child proc or  
attaching to pre-existing process.  

# notes n stuff
on x86 (and x86-64?), when tracing syscalls the value -38 (ENOSYS) is loaded into rax when  
at a syscall-enter-stop. the original syscall value can be found by accessing orig_rax in  
struct user_regs_struct (SIGTRAP and all other signals occurs after syscall-exit-stop)  

for now only x86-64 ABI is expected by the program and next to do is:
- implement PTRACE_ATTACH
- add support for next 200 or so syscalls

i do intend on developing past these objectives but probably wont update the repo after.
